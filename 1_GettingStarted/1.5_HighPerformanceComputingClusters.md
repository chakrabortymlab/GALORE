#   Working on a High-Performance Computing Resource

This is an optional module with instructions for using an High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster if you have access to one through your institution.
## Accessing a Remote HPC Cluster
Computer clusters (or just "clusters" for short) are collections of many computers that are networked together to form a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. These interconnected computers have software to coordinate programs on (or across) those computers, and they can therefore work together to perform computationally intensive tasks. If you have access to an HPC through your institution or another resource, these modules will include steps that you can take to utilize an HPC for tasks like genome assembly or mapping sequencing reads. For more specific details about your own institution's HPC, refer to the appropriate site.


### On Mac/Linux:
Use the terminal:

```bash
ssh netid@cluster.institution.edu
```

### On Windows (MobaXTerm):
- Open MobaXTerm
- Click "Session" â†’ "SSH"
- Remote host: `cluster.institution.edu`
- Specify username 
- Accept Duo or other prompt

_Replace `cluster.institution.edu` with your institution's login address (ex. `grace.hprc.tamu.edu`)._
