# Installing Bioinformatics Software Using Conda

##  Goals
- Understand what conda is and why itâ€™s used in bioinformatics
- Learn to create a conda environment
- Install bioinformatics tools

---

## Background

Conda is a package manager that helps you:
- Install software and their dependencies (additional software needed to run)
- Avoid version conflicts

In bioinformatics, conda is commonly used via the **Bioconda** channel, which hosts many of the tools needed to perform genomics analysis.

## Step 1: Install Miniconda

Download Miniconda
- Link: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Pick the right installer for your operating system (Linux/macOS 64-bit, Windows)
- Install using the terminal (for Linux/macOS):

```bash
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

- Follow the prompts (accept license, specify install location)

---

## Step 2: Set Up Channels

Once Miniconda is installed, configure the channels for bioinformatics tools:

```bash
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

The order matters: bioconda depends on conda-forge.

---

## Step 3: Create and Activate a Conda Environment

Create an environment to avoid conflicts:

```bash
conda create -n genomics_env
```

Activate it:

```bash
conda activate genomics_env
```


To see what's installed:

```bash
conda list
```

---


## Step 4: Deactivate and Manage Environments

To deactivate:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

To remove an environment:

```bash
conda env remove -n bioinfo_env
```

To list all environments:

```bash
conda env list
```

## Practice Task

1. Run `samtools --help` to confirm it works
