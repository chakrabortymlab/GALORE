# Using Bioinformatics Software

> ⚠️ *This module is still under construction as we work on providing a publicly accessible coding environment/virtual machine for the project. In the meantime, all required programs can be installed locally using Conda.*



Conda is a package manager that helps you:
- Install software and their dependencies (additional software needed to run)
- Avoid version conflicts

In bioinformatics, conda is commonly used via the **Bioconda** channel, which hosts many of the tools needed to perform genomics analysis.

## Objectives:
- Understand what conda is and why it’s used in bioinformatics
- Learn to create a conda environment
- Install bioinformatics tools

---


## Step 1: Install Miniconda

Download Miniconda
- Link: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Pick the right installer for your operating system (Linux/macOS 64-bit, Windows)
- Install using the terminal (for Linux/macOS):

```bash
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

- Follow the prompts (accept license, specify install location)

---

## Step 2: Set Up Channels

Once Miniconda is installed, configure the channels for bioinformatics tools:

```bash
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

The order matters: bioconda depends on conda-forge.

## Step 3: Create and Activate a Conda Environment

Create an environment to avoid conflicts:

```bash
conda create -n genomics_env
```

Activate it:

```bash
conda activate genomics_env
```


To see what's installed:

```bash
conda list
```

## Step 4: Install necessary softwares
