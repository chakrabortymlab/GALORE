## Module Goals
- Understand why UNIX is useful for bioinformatics
- Navigate directories and files using UNIX commands

## Background
Bioinformatics leverages computer technology to collect, analyze, and store biological data. UNIX and UNIX-like systems (Linux, macOS) are widely used in bioinformatics due to their command-line power, scripting capabilities, and compatibility with many tools.
This pipeline will be conducted entirely in a Unix-based environment, as the majority of bioinformatics tools are designed to run on Unix or Linux systems. Whether you're using macOS, Linux, or accessing a remote server (e.g. through a high-performance computing cluster), a working knowledge of Unix is essential.


### Common Operating Systems
- **UNIX/Linux** (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.): Preferred for bioinformatics
- **macOS**: Based on UNIX; compatible with most commands
- **Windows**: Not UNIX-based, but tools like [MobaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) or [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) enable UNIX-like environments

## Commands
Commands are instructions that we can use to interact with the operating system. We can tell it to manage files, perform tasks, run a program.

## Accessing a Remote HPC Cluster
Computer clusters (or just "clusters" for short) are collections of many computers that are networked together to form a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. These interconnected computers have software to coordinate programs on (or across) those computers, and they can therefore work together to perform computationally intensive tasks. If you have access to an HPC through your institution or another resource, these modules will include steps that you can take to utilize an HPC for tasks like genome assembly or mapping sequencing reads. For more specific details about your own institution's HPC, refer to the appropriate site.


### On Mac/Linux:
Use the terminal:

```bash
ssh netid@cluster.institution.edu
```

### On Windows (MobaXTerm):
- Open MobaXTerm
- Click "Session" → "SSH"
- Remote host: `cluster.institution.edu`
- Specify username 
- Accept Duo or other prompt

_Replace `cluster.institution.edu` with your institution's login address (ex. `grace.hprc.tamu.edu`)._

## Basic UNIX Navigation

A file system is the method an operating system uses to organize and store files on a computer. Instead of clicking on a folder’s name to view the contents as you would in Mac Finder or File Explorer on your laptop, in a terminal you need to explicitly write out nested directories as a ‘path’. Files are arranged in a hierarchical structure, like a tree, with directories (also called folders) and subdirectories (folders within folders). 



### Print Working Directory
```bash
pwd
```
This shows your current location in the file system.

### Change Directory
```bash
cd /path/to/folder
```
Use `cd ..` to move one level up.

### Make a New Directory
```bash
mkdir Lab1
```

### List Contents
```bash
ls
```

---

## Working with Files

### Create a File with `nano`
You can create, name, and edit a text file in a single line using `nano`
```bash
nano test.txt
```
This creates a new file calles test.txt which we can now edit. Type content and then press `Ctrl+X`, `Y`, and `Enter` to save.

### View File Contents
A quick way to view a large file if you don't need to edit it is with the command `less` 
```bash
less test.txt
# or
nano test.txt
```
Use `q` to exit `less`.

### Copy a File
```bash
cp test.txt test_copy.txt
```
Here, we are creating a new file called test_copy.txt which has the same contents as test.txt
### Rename a File
```bash
mv test.txt original_test.txt
```
Here, we are changing the name of the file test.txt to original_test.txt
### Move a File
```bash
mv original_test.txt new_dir/
```

---

## Using File Paths
If a file is not in your current directory, you need its **path**:

```bash
less new_dir/original_test.txt
```
Or:
```bash
cd new_dir
less original_test.txt
```

To return to your previous directory:
```bash
cd ..
```

## Deleting Files and Folders (Careful!)
If you delete a file or folder, you can't get it back - so be careful when using this command.
```bash
rm filename
rm -r foldername  # Deletes directories and contents
```
