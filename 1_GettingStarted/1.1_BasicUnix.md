# Basics of UNIX

Bioinformatics relies heavily on computational tools to analyze and interpret biological data. Most of these tools are designed to run on UNIX or UNIX-like systems such as Linux and macOS. These systems are powerful for command-line operations, scripting, and handling large datasets.

Whether you’re working on a Mac or a Linux machine, a basic understanding of UNIX is essential for running bioinformatics pipelines.

## Objectives:
- Understand why UNIX is useful in bioinformatics
- Learn to navigate directories and files using UNIX commands

## The Terminal and Commands

The terminal (also called the command line or shell) is a text-based interface used to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking on icons and menus, you type commands to tell the computer what to do.

Each command typically follows this structure:

```bash
command [options] [arguments]
```

- `command`: the action you want to perform
- `options`: modify the behavior of the command (often start with a hyphen, -)
- `arguments`: the target of the command (like a file or directory name)

### Comments in the Terminal

Lines starting with a `#` are comments. These are ignored by the computer but are helpful for explaining code.

```bash
# This line is a comment and will not run
```

### Example: The `echo` Command

```bash
# Print out the word 'hello'
echo hello
```

This prints `hello` to the screen. Here, `hello` is the argument to the `echo` command. Not all commands require arguments, but many do.

## Navigating the Filesystem

Your computer’s filesystem is organized like a tree, with a top-level root directory and nested folders (called directories) and files. When using the terminal, you need to type paths to navigate directories and interact with files.

### Show Your Current Directory

```bash
pwd
```

This prints the current working directory, showing where you are in the filesystem.

### Change Directory

```bash
cd /path/to/folder
```

- Replace `/path/to/folder` with the actual path to a directory.
- Use `cd ..` to move up one level (to the previous directory).

### Make a New Directory

```bash
mkdir Lab1
```

This creates a new directory called `Lab1` in your current location.

### List Directory Contents

```bash
ls
```

This lists the files and folders in your current directory. You can add options:

- `ls -l`: long listing format, gives you much more detailed information about files and directories.
- `ls -lh`: gives human-readable file sizes (MB, GB).

## Creating and Editing Files

### Create and Edit a File Using `nano`

```bash
nano test.txt
```

This opens the text editor `nano` to create or edit a file called `test.txt`. After typing content:

- Press `Ctrl + X` to exit
- Press `Y` to confirm saving
- Press `Enter` to confirm the filename

### View File Contents Without Editing

Use `less` to view a file:

```bash
less test.txt
```

This opens the file in a scrollable viewer. Use:

- Arrow keys to scroll
- `q` to quit

Alternatively, `nano test.txt` also shows the file but opens it in edit mode. Don't use this for large genomic data files, as they will take a long time to open.

---

## Copying, Moving, and Renaming Files

### Copy a File

```bash
cp test.txt test_copy.txt
```

This makes a new file called `test_copy.txt` with the same contents as `test.txt`.

### Rename or Move a File

```bash
mv test.txt original_test.txt
```

This renames `test.txt` to `original_test.txt`.

```bash
mv original_test.txt new_dir/
```

This moves the file into a directory named `new_dir`. 

---

## Using File Paths

A **path** describes the location of a file or directory. Paths can be:

- **Absolute**: from the root directory (ex. `/User/Alex/project/test.txt`)
- **Relative**: from your current location (ex. `project/test.txt`)

To view a file in another directory:

```bash
less new_dir/original_test.txt
```

Or change into that directory first:

```bash
cd new_dir
less original_test.txt
```

To return to the previous directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

---

## Deleting Files and Folders (Be Careful!)

Deletion is permanent - there is no "Trash Bin” in UNIX. Use with caution!

### Delete a File

```bash
rm filename.txt
```

### Delete a Directory and Its Contents

```bash
rm -r foldername
```

The `-r` (recursive) option tells `rm` to delete the folder and everything inside it.

---

## Practice Suggestions

Try the following:

1. Use `mkdir` to create a new directory.
2. Use `cd` and `pwd` to navigate to it.
3. Create a file using `nano`, add some text, and save it.
4. View the file using `less`.
5. Copy and rename the file using `cp` and `mv`.
6. Use `rm` to delete the copy (carefully!).

By practicing these commands, you'll become more comfortable navigating and managing files in UNIX - a critical skill in any bioinformatics workflow.
