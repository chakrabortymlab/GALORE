## Obtaining Sequencing Reads

The raw genomic data used in this module consist of long-read sequencing reads generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies. These reads are stored in FASTQ format.

All sequencing data for the 11 *Drosophila melanogaster* strains are publicly available from the **NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)**.

To download these files:

1. **Install SRA Toolkit**, a command-line utility for accessing and downloading sequencing data from NCBI.
2. Use the command `fasterq-dump`, which retrieves and converts data from SRA format into standard FASTQ files.

**Example command:**

```bash
fasterq-dump SRRXXXXXXX
```

Replace `SRRXXXXXXX` with the accession number of the dataset you're interested in, for example SRR32117935.

> **Tip:** Youâ€™ll need quite a bit of storage space and a stable internet connection, as these datasets can be several gigabytes in size.

Once downloaded, these FASTQ files will be used in downstream steps like genome assembly and variant calling. Feel free to practice directory commands and renaming files to organize strain data.

Example:
```bash
mv BL1349_ont_reads.fastq
```
