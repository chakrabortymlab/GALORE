# GALORE
<b>Introduction</b  
One major limitation of teaching genomics in a classroom is that students do not get hands-on experience with the biological data to which their theoretical knowledge and computational exercises can be applied, limiting the learning outcomes. To address this issue, Dr. Mahul Chakraborty, with help from his Ph.D. student Alex Samano, launched a new undergraduate genomics course (BIOL 450) in the Department of Biology, Texas A&M University that integrates cutting-edge computational approaches and wet lab experiments to help learn genomics through course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). Here, we make the materials from the course available so that anyone in the world, whether in a classroom or at home, can use these resources to learn genomics. We named this resource Genomics and Long Reads Education (GALORE). Please email Mahul (mahul@tamu.edu) if you have questions about the resource or its use.
