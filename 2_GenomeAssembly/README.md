# Module 2: Genome Assembly

This module introduces the process of generating and evaluating genome assemblies from raw sequencing data.  


**2.1 Filtering Sequencing Reads**  
   Learn how to clean raw sequencing reads before assembly.

**2.2 Genome Assembly**  
   Assemble filtered reads into contigs and scaffolds.

**2.3 Quality Checking Genome Assemblies**  
   Assess assembly contiguity and learn about other metrics for assessing quality of assemblies
