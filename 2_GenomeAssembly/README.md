## Genome Assembly
Genome assembly is the process of stitching together overlapping sequencing reads to reconstruct the original genome. Now that we have the raw sequencing reads downloaded from NCBI we can proceed to assemble them into a de novo genome assembly.
These modules will show you how to prepare the reads, assemble the genome, and assess the quality. The optional module 2.3 can be done if resouces permit, but if not, the assembly generated can be used for Variant Calling modules.
