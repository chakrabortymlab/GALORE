# Filtering Reads

The data obtained from NCBI includes all sequencing reads, but not all of them are ideal for analysis. Oxford Nanopore technology provides long reads with high coverage but at the cost of a higher error rate compared to short-read sequencing. To improve the quality of downstream analyses, it is important to filter reads by length and quality.

We use `chopper`, a tool that quickly filters sequencing reads based on average quality and length. For genome assembly, itâ€™s best to retain only the longest and highest quality reads.

The following command filters out reads with:
- Average quality < 10
- Length < 500 bp

```bash
# Clean reads to remove Q<10 and length<500
conda activate chopper_env

chopper -q 10 -l 500 -i ZI457N_SRE.fastq > ZI457N_filt.fastq
```
