# Visualizing Variants in IGV


The **Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)** is a powerful desktop application for visualizing read alignments and variant calls.  
In this tutorial, we will use IGV to interpret structural variants and SNPs identified from read mapping.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the reference genome (ISO1) and your strain’s data (assemblies, FASTQ, VCFs as appropriate).
- Load required software modules or install tools if working locally.


---

## Step 1: Install and Launch IGV

1. Download IGV: [https://igv.org/app](https://igv.org/app)  
2. Launch IGV and choose the genome **Drosophila melanogaster (dm6)**.  
   - If not available, use **Genomes → Load Genome from File…** and select your FASTA (e.g. `dmel-all-chromosome-r6.63.fasta`).

---

## Step 2: Load Your Data

1. Load your BAM alignment file:
   - `File → Load from File… → BL2969_iso1ref_sorted.bam`  
   - Also load the BAM index (`.bam.bai`) if IGV does not automatically detect it.

2. Load your VCF file:
   - `File → Load from File… → BL2969_sniffles.vcf` or `BL2969_freebayes.vcf`.

3. Ensure tracks are visible:
   - You should see:
     - **Coverage track** (histogram of read depth).  
     - **Read alignments** (individual reads with mismatches highlighted).  
     - **Variant calls** (from VCF).

## Step 3: Navigate to Your Gene of Interest

1. Paste your FlyBase coordinates (e.g. `2R:7782797-7785067`) into the IGV search bar.  
2. Press Enter.  
3. IGV will zoom to the gene region.

## Step 4: Interpret Variant Patterns

### 4.1 SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)
- **What you’ll see:**  
  - A pileup of reads where a single base differs from the reference.  
  - Reads with mismatches will show colored bases (A=green, C=blue, G=orange, T=red).  

---

### 4.2 Deletions
- **What you’ll see:**  
  - A sharp drop in the coverage histogram.  
  - Reads with **black lines** (gaps) across the missing region. 
---

### 4.3 Duplications
- **What you’ll see:**  
  - A bump or **increase in coverage depth** compared to surrounding regions.  
  - Reads align normally, but the coverage histogram is significantly higher.  

---

### 4.4 Insertions
- **What you’ll see:**  
  - Split or soft-clipped reads at the insertion boundary.  
  - Reads align partially, with clipped bases shown at the edges.

## Step 5: Save Evidence

- Use **View → Preferences → Save PNG/SVG** to export snapshots.
