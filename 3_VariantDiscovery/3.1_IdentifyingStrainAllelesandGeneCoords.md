# Identifying Strain Alleles and Gene Coordinates in FlyBase

## Module Goals:
1. Identifying what alleles a *Drosophila melanogaster* strain carries using its Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) ID.  
2. Finding the genomic coordinates of those alleles in FlyBase.

## Part 1: Identify Alleles from the BDSC Website

The Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) maintains information about thousands of *Drosophila* strains. You can use the strain ID to find out which alleles are present.

### Steps

1. Go to the BDSC website:  
   [https://bdsc.indiana.edu](https://bdsc.indiana.edu)

2. In the search bar, type your strain number (omit the “BL” prefix).  
   - Example: If your strain is BL622, search for 622.

3. On the strain page, scroll to **Components and Genes**.  
   - Here you will find a list of mutations present in the strain, along with their gene associations.

4. Follow the provided links to **FlyBase**:
   - The strain entry will link directly to the relevant FlyBase gene and allele pages.
   - Example: The `bw` mutation links to the **bw gene page** and **bw1 allele page**.

## Part 2: Find Gene Coordinates in FlyBase

Now that you know which gene has a mutation in your strain, you can look up the exact genomic location in FlyBase.

### Steps

1. Go to [https://flybase.org](https://flybase.org).

2. Use the search bar to enter the gene name.  
   - Example: Search for `cinnabar` or the abbreviation `cn`.

3. On the gene page, scroll to the **Genomic Location** section.  
   - Coordinates are listed in the format:  
     ```
     Chromosome:Start..End
     ```
     Example: `2R:7,782,797..7,785,067`


4. Make a BED File of Your Gene(s)

Remember, a BED file is a simple, tab-delimited text format with at least 3 columns:

```
chrom   start   end
```

- Coordinates in BED are **0-based, half-open**:
  - Start coordinate is **0-based** (subtract 1 from the FlyBase start).  
  - End coordinate is the actual end position.  

### Example

Suppose FlyBase reports the *cinnabar (cn)* gene at:

```
2R:7,782,797..7,785,067
```

The BED entry would be:

```bash
2R	7782796	7785067	cinnabar
```

Explanation:
- `2R` → chromosome  
- `7782796` → start coordinate (FlyBase start – 1)  
- `7785067` → end coordinate  
- `cinnabar` → gene name (optional 4th column)
