# Visualizing Variants in IGV


The **Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)** is a powerful desktop application for visualizing read alignments and variant calls.  
In this tutorial, we will use IGV to interpret structural variants and SNPs identified from read mapping.

## Prerequisites
- You'll need to have generated a BAM file by aligning a strain's reads to the *Drosophila melanogaster* ISO1 reference genome. You will also need to index the BAM file to obtain the .bai file.

## Step 1: Install and Launch IGV

1. Download IGV: [https://igv.org/app](https://igv.org/app)  
2. Launch IGV and choose the genome using: **Genomes →  Select Hosted Genome** and from the dropdown list select **D. melanogaster (dm6)**.  
   - If not available, use **Genomes → Load Genome from File…** and select your FASTA (ex.`dmel-all-chromosome-r6.63.fasta`).

## Step 2: Load Your Data

1. Load your BAM alignment file:
   - `File → Load from File… → BL2969_iso1ref_sorted.bam`  
   - Also load the BAM index (`.bam.bai`) if IGV does not automatically detect it.

## Step 3: Navigate to Your Gene of Interest

1. Paste your FlyBase coordinates (ex. `2R:7782797-7785067`) into the IGV search bar.  
2. Press Enter.  
3. IGV will zoom to the gene region.  

## Breakdown of IGV Tracks

![IGV Tracks](../images/igv_tracks_breakdown.png)
   - `Coverage`: A histogram of read depth
   - `Read alignments`: Individual reads with mismatches highlighted
   - `Annotation`: If you used the D. melanogaster (dm6) 'Hosted Genome' option, IGV will automatically include gene annotation as a track. You can also upload any annotation file (GTF, GFF, BED) to highlight regions of interest.

## Step 4: Interpret Variant Patterns

### 4.1 SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)
- **What you’ll see:**  
  - A pileup of reads where a single base differs from the reference.  
  - Reads with mismatches will show colored bases (A=green, C=blue, G=orange, T=red).  

In this example, a T (red) is replaced by an A (green) in all of the reads.

### 4.2 Deletions
- **What you’ll see:**  
  - A sharp drop in the coverage histogram.  
  - Reads with **black lines** (gaps) across the missing region. 

In this example, the reads show a deletion of ~202 bp which is why we see a sharp drop in coverage over the deleted sequence.

### 4.3 Duplications
- **What you’ll see:**  
  - A bump or **increase in coverage depth** compared to surrounding regions. This is because there are more copies of the sequence in the sample than in the reference, therefore more reads map to that sequence.  
  - Reads may be clipped or split (red bars at the end of reads) if they span the breakpoints of the duplicated sequence.

### 4.4 Insertions
- **What you’ll see:**  
  - Inserted bases are shown as purple text in the read if they are small enough to fit within the aligned read.
  - If an insertion is much larger than the read length, then reads from this region may not align at all or reads align partially, with clipped bases shown at the edges.

## Step 5: Save Evidence

- Use **View → Preferences → Save PNG/SVG** to export snapshots.
