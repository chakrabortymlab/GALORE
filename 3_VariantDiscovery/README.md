# Module 3: Variant Discovery

This module introduces methods to discover and interpret genetic variation in *Drosophila melanogaster*.  

**3.1 Identifying Strain Alleles and Gene Coordinates**  
   Learn to use BDSC and FlyBase to find gene coordinates for your strain.

**3.2 Whole-Genome Alignment**  
   Align your strain assembly to the ISO1 reference, learn how to interpret alignment dot plots, and call variants based on alignments.

**3.3 Variant Calling with Read Mapping**  
   Map sequencing reads, call SNPs and structural variants, and compare with alignment-based findings.

**3.4 Intersecting Variants with Genes**  
   Filter variant calls to isolate mutations that intersect genes linked to visible phenotypes.

**3.5 Visualizing Variants in IGV**  
   Load BAM files into IGV and visually validate SNPs and SVs.

**3.6 Interpreting Variants**
   Integrate results across approaches to build evidence for candidate variants.
