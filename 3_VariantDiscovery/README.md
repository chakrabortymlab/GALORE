# Module 3: Variant Discovery

This module introduces methods to discover and interpret genetic variation in *Drosophila melanogaster*.  

te results across approaches to build evidence for candidate variants.  

**3.1 Identifying Strain Alleles and Gene Coordinates**  
   Learn to use BDSC and FlyBase to find gene coordinates for your strain.

**3.2 Whole-Genome Alignment**  
   Align your strain assembly to the ISO1 reference and prepare for structural variant discovery.

**3.3 Visualizing Whole-Genome Alignment (Dot Plots)**  
   Generate dot plots from alignment data and interpret patterns (inversions, duplications, deletions).

**3.4 Variant Calling with Read Mapping**  
   Map sequencing reads, call SNPs and structural variants, and compare with alignment-based findings.

**3.5 Visualizing Variants in IGV**  
   Load BAM and VCF files into IGV and visually validate SNPs, deletions, and duplications.
