# Interpreting and Reporting Variants

In this final part of this project, we will integrate results from allele lookup, genome alignment, dot plots, read mapping, variant calling, and IGV visualization to interpret the **biological impact of genetic variants**.

---

## Objectives:

- Summarize the variants identified across different approaches.  
- Cross-check results between computational methods (VCF/SVMU) and visualization (IGV, dot plots).  
- Infer possible **functional effects** of variants.  
- Connect identified variants to **observable phenotypes** in the strain.

### Step 1: Summarize Variants Across Methods

Prepare a simple table of results for the visible phenotype(s) you are investigating. For example, if you are investigating the *vermillion*<sup>1</sup> allele associated with bright red eye color, consolidate evidence for the candidate mutations identified in the *vermillion* gene.

For each variant, note:

| Variant ID | Method Detected (Genome Alignment, Read Mapping) | Coordinates | Variant Type (SNP/DEL/DUP/INV) | Evidence (coverage bump, dot plot inversion etc.) |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|

Example entry:

| v1 | Genome Alignment |X:13,654,433-13,656,010 | Insertion | Insertion visible in dot plot|

---

### Step 2: Cross-Validate Variants

- **Compare VCF calls with IGV visualization.**  
  Does IGV show coverage bumps for duplications? Coverage dips for deletions? Colored bases for SNPs?  

- **Check SVMU structural variant calls against dot plots.**  
  Do inversions or duplications appear as expected in the dot plot?  

---

### Step 3: Cross-check strains not showing the visible phenotype
When analyzing a strain with a visible phenotype linked to a specific gene, you may find multiple candidate mutations within that gene. A key question is whether these mutations are unique to the strain(s) showing the phenotype.

- If the same mutation also appears in strains without the phenotype, it is less likely to be causal.

- If the mutation is found only in the strain(s) showing the phenotype, this provides stronger evidence that it may be responsible.

To assess this, repeat your analysis across all 11 strains and check whether each candidate mutation is shared or unique. 

Update your table to include this information:

| Variant ID | Method Detected | Coordinates | Type | Evidence | **Unique to Strain?** | 
|------------|-----------------|-------------|------|----------|-----------------------|

---

### Step 4: Infer Functional Effects

As shown in Module 3.1, the JBrowse genome browser in FlyBase can be used to examine gene structure - for example, the positions of UTRs, coding sequences, and introns within a transcript. By combining this information with the coordinates of a candidate mutation, we can place mutations in their genomic context and begin to infer their potential functional effects.

Ask the following questions for each variant:

- Does it fall **within a coding sequence**?  
  - Could it cause a frameshift, nonsense, or missense mutation?  
- Is it a **deletion or duplication** of a gene?  
  - Could it change gene dosage?  
- Does it fall in a **noncoding regulatory region**?  
  - Could it disrupt enhancer function and gene expression?  

Add a column to your table:

| Variant ID | Method Detected | Coordinates | Type | Evidence | Unique to Strain? | **Predicted Effect** |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|

---

### Step 5: Connect to Phenotype

- If the gene is associated with a known **visible marker phenotype** (from BDSC/FlyBase), describe how the mutation might explain the trait. You can integrate information about the gene's function from FlyBase.
- Example:  
  - The *plexus* protein normally restricts excess wing vein development by repressing transcription of a wing-vein–associated gene. A duplication of an exon in the *plexus* gene could disrupt the protein’s structure and impair its ability to repress transcription, leading to the excess wing vein phenotype observed in strain BL156, which carries the *px*<sup>1</sup> mutation

## In Conclusion
This final step brings the workflow full circle - from identifying variants to interpreting their biological significance. By linking **computational variant discovery** with **gene annotations**, **genome browser visualization**, and **functional reasoning**, we move beyond simply detecting mutations to understanding their potential effects on phenotype. This integration of bioinformatics and biology is the ultimate goal of variant analysis: not just cataloging genetic differences, but uncovering how those differences shape the traits we observe.

## Looking Ahead

While this tutorial focused on discovering and interpreting candidate variants in individual strains, the same principles extend to larger-scale analyses. Moving forward, you could:

- Validate candidate mutations experimentally (ex. CRISPR editing, gene expression assays) to confirm their functional roles.

- Integrate multiple data types (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq) to connect mutations with changes in gene regulation and expression.

- Explore evolutionary questions such as how structural variants and SNPs contribute to adaptation, sexual dimorphism, or trait diversity in *Drosophila*.

By combining computational discovery with biological interpretation and experimental follow-up, you can build a comprehensive picture of how genetic variation drives phenotypic diversity.
