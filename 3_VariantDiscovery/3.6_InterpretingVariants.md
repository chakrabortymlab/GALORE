# Interpreting and Reporting Variants

In this final part of this project, we will integrate results from allele lookup, genome alignment, dot plots, read mapping, variant calling, and IGV visualization to interpret the **biological impact of genetic variants**.

---

## Module Goals

- Summarize the variants identified across different approaches.  
- Cross-check results between computational methods (VCF/SVMU) and visualization (IGV, dot plots).  
- Infer possible **functional effects** of variants.  
- Connect identified variants to **observable phenotypes** in the strain.

## Step 1: Summarize Variants Across Methods

Prepare a simple table of results. For each variant, note:

| Variant ID | Method Detected (Genome Alignment, Read Mapping) | Coordinates | Variant Type (SNP/DEL/DUP/INV) | Evidence (coverage bump, dot plot inversion etc.) |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|

Example entry:

| v1 | Genome Alignment |X:13,654,433-13,656,010 | Insertion | Insertion visible in dot plot|

---

## Step 2: Cross-Validate Variants

- **Compare VCF calls with IGV visualization.**  
  Does IGV show coverage bumps for duplications? Coverage dips for deletions? Colored bases for SNPs?  

- **Check SVMU structural variant calls against dot plots.**  
  Do inversions or duplications appear as expected in the dot plot?  

---

## Step 3: Infer Functional Effects

Ask the following questions for each variant:

- Does it fall **within a coding sequence**?  
  - Could it cause a frameshift, nonsense, or missense mutation?  
- Is it a **deletion or duplication** of a gene?  
  - Could it change gene dosage?  
- Does it fall in a **noncoding regulatory region**?  
  - Could it disrupt enhancer function and gene expression?  

Add a column to your table:

| Variant ID | Method Detected | Coordinates | Type | Evidence | **Predicted Effect** |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|------|----------|----------------------|

---

## Step 4: Connect to Phenotype

- If the gene is associated with a known **visible marker phenotype** (from BDSC/FlyBase), describe how the mutation might explain the trait. You can integrate information about the gene's function from FlyBase.
- Example:  
  - A duplication of an exon in *plexus* could affect the protein structure, and thus impacts wing-vein development.

This final step demonstrates the full workflow of **variant discovery to biological interpretation**!!!!!!.
